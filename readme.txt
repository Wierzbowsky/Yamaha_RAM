This reposity contains PCB and Gerber files as well as pictures and the schematics for the Yamaha YIS503 RAM
board designed by Kamil Karimov. The board can be used as 512kb and as 1mb RAM expansion in Yamaha MSX2 computers
without any modification to the mainboard. To be used in Yamaha MSX1 computers a few additional components must be
installed onto the mainboard to support missing signals.

Mr. Karimov gave his permission to put his files into the repository. However it's not allowed to use any of the
files in this repository for commercial purposes without the permission from the author. Making a small batch of
boards, using some of the boards for personal projects and selling the remaining boards is permitted.
